                <p id="description">
                    One of my earliest projects was creating an agent that learns to play
                    flappy bird in python using a feed forward neural network. I used
                    numpy and pygame to handle matrix operations and graphical user
                    interface respectively

                    Agent Trained to Oppose Me (A.T.O.M) is a bot created to compete
                    against the user in tic tac toe. It uses minimax to evaluate the board
                    state and choose the best possible move. It was made in python and
                    uses no additional libraries (with the exception of the discord api)

                    My Extended Project Qualification (EPQ) uses logistic regression to
                    recomed films to a given user. It is built in python using the Tkinter
                    library for graphical user interface and Numpy for matrix operations.

                    Uses an LSTM to perform setiment analysis on user's text input. This
                    data is combined with other data collected via some unconventional
                    methods and k nearest neighbour is performed on it to recommend career
                    paths suited to the user.
